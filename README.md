Confluent
=========

Confluence is a [pretty whack documentation tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_%28software%29) that I've had to use a fair amount. I use [Readability](https://readability.com/) when reading nonwork articles, but Readbility sends articles to its own server and that clearly won't do for work articles, which might be sensitive.

So I made Confluent! Confluent only works on pages HTTPS pages with /confluence/display/ or /confluence/pages/ in the URL. It restyles some elements to make articles easier to read.

Cool! The Confluent code is (right now) pretty light. Feel free to dive in and add things! If there's an serious activity I'll update the extension on the Chrome Extension Store.
